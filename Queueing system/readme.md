# Queue restyling script
**Use and purposes of the script**
The main use of the script was to restyle an existing site used to communicate between pupil and teacher.
The site had no css however. Using javascript and the dev console, or snippet; I could make the site pretty and add additional functionality as seen fit.
> **Items learnt from the exeperience**

> Regex, modifying urls in strings into clickable hrefs
